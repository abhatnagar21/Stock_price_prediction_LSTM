# Stock_price_prediction_LSTM
Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
This project aims to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. The project demonstrates how to preprocess stock market data, build and train an LSTM model, and evaluate its performance.

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Sequence generation for LSTM input
- LSTM model building and training
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Use of early stopping and model checkpoints to prevent overfitting

- The dataset used in this project contains historical stock prices with features such as 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and 'Volume'. Ensure that your dataset file (CSV format) is placed in the project directory.

# Stock_price_prediction_LSTM
Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
This project aims to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. The project demonstrates how to preprocess stock market data, build and train an LSTM model, and evaluate its performance.

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Sequence generation for LSTM input
- LSTM model building and training
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Use of early stopping and model checkpoints to prevent overfitting

- The dataset used in this project contains historical stock prices with features such as 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and 'Volume'. Ensure that your dataset file (CSV format) is placed in the project directory.

Here's how to improve accuracy of model:
Feature Engineering:
Additional Features: The improved code includes new features such as Open-Close and High-Low, which can provide more context to the model beyond the Close price. More features often help the model to better understand the underlying patterns in the data.

Validation Split:
Validation Data: By using a validation split, the model can be monitored for performance on unseen data during training. This helps in tuning the model and preventing overfitting.

Early Stopping and Model Checkpoints:
Early Stopping: This technique stops the training process if the validation loss does not improve for a specified number of epochs (patience), thereby preventing overfitting and reducing unnecessary computation.
Model Checkpoints: This ensures that the best version of the model (in terms of validation loss) is saved during training. If the model starts to overfit, the best version will still be preserved.

Data Concatenation for Inverse Transform:
Inverse Transformation: The predictions are concatenated with zeros for the additional features before being inverse transformed. This ensures that the shape of the data matches the expectations of the scaler.inverse_transform method, leading to accurate rescaling of predictions back to their original scale.

Improved Plotting Logic:
Matching Dimensions: Adjusted the plotting logic to ensure that the dimensions of the predictions match the corresponding date ranges, preventing shape mismatches.
